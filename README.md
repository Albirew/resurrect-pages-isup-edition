# Documentation

Dead pages, broken links, the scourge of the internet.
Powerhouse sites like Slashdot and Digg can bring a server to its knees.
What do we do when a page is dead but we still want to see it?
Call in the clerics, and perform a resurrection ceremony!
Or, the easier route, use this extension.

## Features

 * Searches through six page cache/mirrors:
   * [Google Cache](http://www.google.com/) (plus text-only version)
   * [The Internet Archive](http://web.archive.org/)
   * [WebCite](http://www.webcitation.org/)
   * [archive.is](https://archive.is/)
   * [Memento Time Travel](http://timetravel.mementoweb.org/)
   * [Down for everyone?](http://www.isup.me/)

Of course, not every page can be in every cache.
When a page is unavailable, you'll generally see that site's error page.
Hit back and try another one!

 * Accessible:
   * In the context (right-click) menu for the current page, and for all links.
   * In the toolbar, just customize it to drag the button in.
   * With the keyboard: press `Ctrl-Shift-U`
